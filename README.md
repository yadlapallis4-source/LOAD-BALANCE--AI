# LOAD-BALANCE--AI
The Center-of-Gravity-Aware Load Planning system improves logistics safety by optimizing cargo placement inside vehicles using physics principles like center of mass and torque. It analyzes cargo weight and position to recommend balanced layouts, reducing instability during braking turning and acceleration while improving fuel efficiency and safety
